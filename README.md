The project will be realized within Diploma Project at University. The goal of this project is to create a program which will count cells on the image. The program will be created with using Python and  will be used technologies such as digital images processing and neural networks.

I used image set BBBC038v1 [Caicedo et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636459], available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection.
